# learning-three-js


## Background
I tried learning some three-js to use in the tom-clover website.
I tried following along with some tutorials and had some success making three-js environment locally.
I realised I would need a bundler like webpack to use three-js in the tom-clover website.
I got it kinda working with Vite running locally (which I think bundles code for you) but couldn't get that over to the live site.
So we just used a recording of the 3D dog spinning in the three-js environment instead.
